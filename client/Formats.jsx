                    <h3>Imperial Law [FFG]</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Imperial Law was the official ban and restricted lists published by Fantasy Flight Games [FFG]. 
                        They were released every 3 months in FFG's website, and were focused on balancing the game through a 
                        combination of bans, restrictions, and erratas.

                    <h3>Skirmish [FFG]</h3>
                    <p>
                        Skirmish was an alternative format released by FFG. It changed many core rules of the game, like getting rid of strongholds and provinces, 
                        and reducing the flow of resources in the game. The goal of Skirmish was to have an easier to learn and faster to play version of L5R. The 
                        format was released in these two articles: 
                        <a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2020/3/20/legend-of-the-five-rings-skirmish-part-1/" target="_blank">part 1</a>, and 
                        <a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2020/3/27/legend-of-the-five-rings-skirmish-part-2/" target="_blank">part 2</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Emerald Legacy [Community] [current]</h3>
                    <p>
                        When FFG announced they would stop releasing the game, the community formed a group to take the stewardship of the game, this group is 
                        the Emerald Legacy. The Emerald Legacy continues to publish cards, and took the role of maintaining game balance through ban and restricted 
                        lists. It also introduced a few rule changes to the game in regards to Rally, attachments, and covert.

                    <h3>Obsidian Heresy [Community] [current]</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Obsidian Heresy is an alternative format that aims to keep L5R pure in its impurity. The Obsidian legacy maintains a short ban list, 
                        and has no restricted cards. It introduces a big rule change in making the maximum ammount of copies per card in decks 2 instead of 3 copies.
                        Obsidian is a wild format, where mostly everything is possible, and fire is fought with fire. The format recommends playing matches as best of 3.

                    <h3>Jade Edict [Community] [discontinued]</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Jade Edict was a community made balance patch for L5R. It started being developed a few months before the announcement that FFG would stop 
                        publishing L5R, and it was released one week after that announcement. Jade was developed with a strong focus on clan balance and competitive 
                        play, and it changed the Rally rule by removing it completely from the game. 
                        <a href="https://www.jadecourt.org/" target="_blank">Learn more about the Jade Edict in their website</a>. With the release of the Emerald Legacy, the 
                        Jade Edict was discontinued.
